              PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to
              web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian
              programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference
              implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally
              stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive
              initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

              PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter
              implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface
              (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted
              and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as
              generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part
              of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
              management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed
              to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
              Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside
              of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and
              robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from
              the command line.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
              software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely
              ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every
              operating system and platform, free of charge.

              CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit -
              for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable
              you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were
              writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries
              for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and
              logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you
              creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code
              needed for a given task.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Where possible, CodeIgniter has been kept as flexible as possible,
              allowing you to work in the way you want, not being forced into
              working any certain way. The framework can have core parts easily
              extended or completely replaced to make the system work the way
              you need it to. In short, CodeIgniter is the malleable framework
              that tries to provide the tools you need while staying out of the
              way.
